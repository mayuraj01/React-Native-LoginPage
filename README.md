# React Native Login Screen ðŸ“±

This is a simple React Native app built using Expo. It demonstrates how a basic login screen works, including UI design, input handling, and form validation.


# Features
- Email and Password input fields
- Show/Hide password functionality
- Login button with alert popup showing entered info
- Basic email validation
- Mock `users.json` file for backend integration
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- "Forgot Password?" and "Sign Up" links (non-functional for now)

# Project Structure
LoginApp/
    â”€ App.js    # Main app file
    â”€ components/
       â”€ LoginScreen.js    # Contains login screen UI and logic
    â”€ backend/
       â”€ users.json       # Mock data for email/password
    â”€ README.md # You're reading this!


# How It Works

1. UI Components
- The main screen is in `components/LoginScreen.js`
- It uses `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity`, and `Alert` from React Native.
- Inputs are controlled using local state (`useState`).

2. Input Handling
- When you type in the Email and Password fields, the values are saved in the component state.
- When the Login button is clicked:
  - It checks if both fields are filled.
  - It checks if the email is in a valid format.
  - Then it shows an alert with the entered email and password.

3. Show/Hide Password
- There's a toggle button to show or hide the password while typing.

4. Backend Mock
- Thereâ€™s a file `backend/users.json` that stores sample login data (just for reference).
